Beanerd is an App where you can save your favorite roasts of coffee and save your brew recipes for them. You can also rate a roast and save new ones. In the future I want to make this into a community app, where small roaster from Germany have a platform for their products and Beanerds can always try something new.

TechStack: Next.js, React.js, JavaScript, NextAuth, mongoDB and mongoose

Personal Highlight: My own toastmessage provider and modal
